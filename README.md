# Spring Code Jam

SPRINT NINJAS

## Hey team 👋🏽 👋🏽 👋🏽


I experimented with something.
I was thinking we can go all out and emulate a real profile instead of a normal website layout. 
but we will still keep it simple.

Where the menu you is I was thinking to put a gellery tab, that switches the content when we click it.

Hove over the profile image you'll see a surprise.

Anyways looking forward to what you think and the ideas you all have to give.
