# Spring Code Jam

SPRINT NINJAS

## Hey team 👋🏽 👋🏽 👋🏽


I experimented with something.
I was thinking we can go all out and emulate a real profile instead of a normal website layout, 
but we will still keep it simple.

Where the menu is I was thinking we can put a tab, that switches some kind of gallery content when we click it.

Hove over the profile image you'll see a surprise.

Anyways looking forward to what you think and the ideas you all have to give.
